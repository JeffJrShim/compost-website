    <h1>When is compost created?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Sir Albert Howard, father of the organic method. Between 1905 and 1934 he devised the Indore method of compost making.</li>
        <li>The first "written" account of compost making is on a set of clay tablets carved during the reign of King Sargon during the Akkadian Dynasty, which lasted about 160 years between 2320 BC and 2120 BC.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>When will compost be ready?</h1>
    <p>Compost can be made in as little as six to eight weeks, or, more usually, it can take a year or more. In general, the more effort you put in, the quicker you will get compost. When the ingredients you have put in your container have turned into a dark brown, earthy-smelling material, the composting process is complete.</p>
